        <p> Touchdown Manila! We linked up with our travel agency namely "DJM Travel and Tours". We hopped on their bus and secured a seat in
          the back, where I kind of felt dizzy from the flight. The bus finally took off, and there we first met our tour guide Sir Enan. 
          He was so nice and you can tell he is very approachable. It took around 35 minutes until we finally arrived in our dormitory. From there
          I get to meet a few of my friends and classmates who arrived in Manila first. The accomodation in the dormitory was so ice, it's giving
          a home-like feels. However, it only felt like a 20minute rest, then our professors announced that we'll leave to proceed to the first itenirary - Rizal Park.
          Time skip, when we arrived, the place is scorching with very high heat temperature. But despite that, we get to see the huge Philippine flag and 
          the statue of Jose Rizal. We took a short stop in a nearby icecream vendor to cool ourselves, then we continued to the next itenirary.

        <p>For the next itenerary: Intramuros, we went deep into the heart of Manila, the city is so modernized but the Intramuros has left 
          remains from the past where it reminds us the story of our old capital went through. Sir Enan gave us a tour inside, from there we can 
          old buildings, old forts, run-down walls, where you can really fell the vintage vibes of the past. Deep into the Intramuros, we finally
          arrived at the Fort Santiago the iconic memorial of the place. We took pictures, and Sir Enan explained the history of the fort. The tour
          inside the Intramuros ended at the Pasig river where we took lots of selfies because the view was mesmerizing. Finally, we exited from where
          we came from and we hopped back to the bus and surprisingly, we still have an extra time to go to the Mall! Our tourist guide said we can visit
          the Mall of Asia for 1 hour and 30mins which made us feel excited but clearly we know that ius not enough time to explore the famous MOA. 
          When we arrived at the mall, me and my firends couldn't decide where to go so we explored to where we can possibly go, and we ended up in a 
          photo studio, food court, and an open area. 1 hour and 30 minutes passed by so quickly so we went back to the meeting place of where the bus waited.
          Finally, when everyone found their way back, we headed back to the dormitory back in Quezon City. It took 45 mins to 1hour this time because of
          the heavy traffic. The day ended when we finally got our proper rest in the dorm, we took our baths, charged our phones, and prepared for tomorrow's 
          early schedule.
